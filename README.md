### Summary
- An intelligent robot rental platform, the project is divided into two parts, one is the client side developed by android studio, and the other is the server side developed by IDEA.
### Introduction
* HelloKebbi APP is a robot "rent-to-own" business. We provide users robot rentals
service by charging them cheap rents per day. Our target customers are people with
emergency and short- term elderly health care needs and families with elderly at
home.
* We also cooperate with the iBox system to bring more convenience to our users.
After the user completed the reservation, he/she can simply go to the nearest iBox
and pick up Kebbi by entering the code which will be showed on the payment
confirm message. When the user is going to return Kebbi, all he/she need to do is
put it back to the iBox to finish the returning process.

* In our system design, we applied the persistence framework by using Mybatis
and Druid based on SpringBoot. A persistence framework hides the database
access functions from the business objects. It substantially reduces the impact to the
business objects when the database is changed. Mybatis provides data mapping
function, encapsulation for accessing underlying data and DAO persistence
framework. It can make us easier develop and configure our DAL layer, and it has
dynamic SQL statements and anti-SQL injection functions.
